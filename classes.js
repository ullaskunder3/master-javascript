// before class concept one must know the following topics
/**
 * Javascript's  prototype system can be interpreted as a somewhat informal take
 * on an object oriented concept called classes. A class define the shape of the type of object
 * - what method and properties it has. Such an object is called an instance of the class
 */

/**
 * Prototypes are useful for defining properties for which all instance of class 
 * share the same value, such as method, properties that differ per instance, 
 * such as our rabbits' type property need to be stored directly in the objects themselves.s
 */

/**
 * So to create an instance of a given class, you have to make an object that derives
 * form the proper prototype, but you also have to make sure it, itself,
 * has the properties that instance of this class are supposed to have. 
 * This is what constructor function does
 */
function makeRabbit(type) {
    let rabbit = Object.create(protoRbbit);
    rabbit.type = type;
    return rabbit;
}
/**
 * Js provides a way to make defining this type of function easier. if you put the keyword new
 * in front of a function call, the function is treated as a constructor. 
 * This means that an object with the right prototype is autometically created, 
 * bound to this in function, and returned at the end of the function.
 * 
 * The prototype object used when constructing object is found by taking 
 * the prototype property of the constructor function

/**
 * Constructors (all functions, in fact) autometically get a prototype names prototype,
 * which by default holds a plain, empty object that derives form Object.prtotype.
 * We can overwrite it with a new object if we want.
 * or we can add properties to the existing object
 * 
 * Convension: name of constructors are capitalized for distinguished fro other functions.
 */

//CLASS
/**
 * Javascript classes are constructor function with a prototype property. 
 * That is how they work and untill 2015, as per the eloquentjavascript stated :)
 * "These days, we have a less awkward notation.""

/**
 * The class keyword starts a class declaration, which allows us to define a constructor 
 * and a set of methods all in a single place.
 * Any number of method may be written inside the declaration's braces. 
 * The one named constructor is treated specially. It provieds the actual constructor function,
 * which will be bound to the name Rabbit.
 * The other are packaged into that constructor's prototype.
 * 
 * Class declaration currently allow only methods 
 * -properties that hold functions-to be added to the prototype.
 * This can be somewhat inconvenient when you want to save a non-function value in there.
 * The nex version of language is probably improve this. for now you ca create such properties
 * by directly manipilating the prototype after you've defined the class.  
 */
//Like function, class can be used both in statements and in expressions. 
//When used as an expression, it doesn’t define a binding 
//but just produces the constructor as a value.
